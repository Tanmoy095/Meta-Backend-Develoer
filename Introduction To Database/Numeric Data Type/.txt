Data type tells the database management system such as MySQL, how to interpret the value of the column. Data types maintain data in the
right format and make sure the value of each column is as expected. The most used data types are numeric, string, and date and time data
types. Let's take the example of a table from the database of an online store. This table collects information on customers in the form of
columns called customer name, order price, product quantity, and total price. Each of these columns must store data in the form of a 
suitable data type. The customer name column can use string data, order type can use a date type, and product quantity and total price 
columns are best suited to numeric data. The focus of this video is a numeric data type. Numeric data types is the generic term used for
all specific data types that let a column store data as numbers in the database. The two most common numeric data types used in databases
are the integer data type, used for a whole number value, and the decimal data type used for number with a fraction value.
To return to our earlier table example, the product quantity column is defined as an integer data type. This is because it holds whole 
numbers only. Fractional numbers can be inserted, but they'll always be automatically rendered up or down to the nearest whole number
of the database. The total price column is a decimal type. This is because it holds fractional numbers. For example, 
      an item that costs $80.90 is a fractional value, 80 is a whole number and 90 is a decimal. Whole numbers can also be inserted. 
      The database will add a decimal point along with a fractional value of zero. In most database management systems, 
      you'll find different types of integer in decimal data types. Each type is intended to store minimum and a maximum number value. 
      For example, in MySQL Database Management System, tiny integer or TINYINT is used for very small integer number value, 
      or the maximum possible value that can be inserted is 255. While integer or INT can be used to store a very big number, 
      the maximum value that it can store is over four billion. These data types can also accept negative and positive values. 
      In some Database Management Systems, you can also force columns to accept positive numbers. This increases the maximum value 
      they can store. You should now be able to explain the numeric data type in a database, and you should also be capable of differentiating 
      between integer and decimal data types.
