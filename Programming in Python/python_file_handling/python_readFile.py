# Python offers several built-in functions that make this easier. 
# The three methods we'll explore in this video are read, readline, and readlines



# The read method returns the entire contents of the file as a string that will contain all the
# characters. You can also pass in an integer to return only the specified 
# number of characters in the file. 


#  The readline function returns a single line as a string. If for example, you have a file 
# with two lines of texts that say, this is the first line and this is the second line. 
# The read file function will return as the output only the first line of text. This is the first line. 
# The readline function can also include an integer argument for returning a specified number of characters on a single line



# The readlines method reads the entire contents of the file and then returns it in an ordered list.
# This allows you to iterate over the list or pick out specific lines based on a condition. 
# If for example, you have a file with four lines of texts and pass a length condition, 
# the readfiles function will return the output, all the lines in your file in the correct order. 
# Files are stored in directories and they have paths. 
# Reading files from the same directory is straightforward.
